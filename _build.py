            <h2 id="overview">The venue at a glance</h2>
            <p>A spacious, air-conditioned event venue in Nigdi, Pune, designed for weddings, family functions, corporate gatherings and memorable celebrations.</p>
            <p>The Big Hall package includes everything: hall, dining, VIP dining and stay.</p>

            <h2 id="spaces">The five spaces</h2>
            <p>Five connected spaces — pick by guest count first, then refine with the <a href="compare.html">space comparison</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Big Hall</strong> — The largest space in the venue: a full-size banquet hall for weddings, receptions and large community events, with room for a stage, seating and procession flow.</p>
            <p><strong>Small Hall</strong> — A mid-sized hall that suits engagements, birthdays, naming ceremonies and family functions — big enough for a stage, close enough to feel personal.</p>
            <p><strong>Dining Hall</strong> — A separate air-conditioned room for the meal — round-table seating for 400 at a time, with catering support so service stays out of the main programme.</p>
            <p><strong>VIP A/C Dining</strong> — A private dining room for close family, elders and honoured guests — quieter than the main hall, finished to the same standard.</p>
            <p><strong>A/C Guest Rooms</strong> — Up to 8 comfortable, air-conditioned bedrooms so out-of-town family can stay at the venue instead of travelling between function and hotel.</p>

            <h2 id="events">Events we host</h2>
            <p>Pick your occasion to see which spaces fit — then plan it with the team.</p>
            <p><strong>Weddings</strong> — Ceremony, reception and dining under one roof — with rooms for family staying overnight.</p>
            <p><strong>Engagements</strong> — Ring ceremonies and intimate gatherings, with a dining space nearby for the meal.</p>
            <p><strong>Receptions</strong> — Stage, seating and a separate dining flow for an evening reception.</p>
            <p><strong>Birthdays</strong> — Room for cake, games and the full guest list — scaled to your party size.</p>
            <p><strong>Naming Ceremonies</strong> — Close family gatherings with a dedicated meal space — and rooms if elders stay over.</p>
            <p><strong>Family Functions</strong> — Anniversaries, thread ceremonies and get-togethers — with room to dine together.</p>
            <p><strong>Corporate Events</strong> — Presentations, meetings and annual functions — acoustic system, LED screen and projector ready.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Gatherings</strong> — Community meetings, festivals and neighbourhood events with space to gather and eat.</p>

            <h2 id="compare">Compare the spaces</h2>
            <p>Capacities as listed by the venue. All spaces are fully air-conditioned. The full <a href="compare.html">differences table</a> is on its own page.</p>

            <h2 id="gallery">Photographs of the venue</h2>
            <p>Real photographs of the halls, dining rooms and guest spaces — no stock imagery.</p>

            <h2 id="facilities">Facilities</h2>
            <p>Grouped by what you'll actually look for when planning an event — comfort, dining, event technology, safety and access. The full list sits on the homepage and the facilities page.</p>

            <h2 id="setups">Event setups</h2>
            <p>Each setup is arranged around your programme. Photos on the homepage are of the venue spaces themselves; real event photography will be added as it becomes available.</p>
            <p><strong>Wedding Setup</strong> — Stage, seating and procession flow in the Big Hall, with the Dining Hall handling the meal for 400 at a time.</p>
            <p><strong>Reception Setup</strong> — Welcome seating, stage moments and a separate dining room so guests can move between programme and meal.</p>
            <p><strong>Corporate Setup</strong> — Rows or clusters with LED screen, projector and acoustic system for presentations and annual functions.</p>
            <p><strong>Family Function Setup</strong> — Flexible seating for anniversaries, naming ceremonies and get-togethers, scaled to your guest list.</p>
            <p><strong>Dining Setup</strong> — Round-table seating for 400 at a time in the Dining Hall, or private service in VIP A/C Dining for 50 at a time.</p>

            <h2 id="heritage">Our namesake</h2>
            <p>This multipurpose hall carries the name of Late Venutai Chavan — a life dedicated to the service of society, and to bringing people together.</p>
            <p>The venue was created as a tribute to that spirit: a well-equipped, welcoming place where neighbours, families and organisations can celebrate milestones and meet, right here in Nigdi Pradhikaran.</p>
